THIS IS MY PROJECT GRADUATE COURSE PROJECT ON PHYSICAL DESIGN: CAD of Digital Circuits

Source code directory contains my program implementing Left Edge Channel Routing Algorithm (Global Routing problem).

I have implemented several channel routing problems successfully with my program.

Input to the program:

Please enter appropriate pins in two lists top[] and bottom[] in the file Figure11.py if you want to solve any other
channel routing problem

File named Figure11.py :

The top and bottom pins of the file named Figure11.py are taken from Figure 11 of the link below:
http://www.ece.utah.edu/~kalla/papers/TCAD2014-optical-interconnects-kalla.pdf 

File named Figure11b.py :

This file runs the same problem by selecting one pin from the left top and other pin from right bottom
(this cell selection is hard coded) and so on.

File named test.py :

This file runs another channel routing problem example from the link below:

All programs are written to run on Python 2.7.

Programs contain top [] and bottom [] lists containing pins to be routed are inside Source code directory. This list is provided
by the user.
