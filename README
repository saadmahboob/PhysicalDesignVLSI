THIS IS MY GRADUATE COURSE PROJECT ON FUNDEMENTAL CAD TECHNIQUES FOR PHYSICAL DESIGN AUTOMATION.

Source code directory contains my program implementing Left Edge Channel Routing Algorithm (Global Routing problem).

I have implemented several channel routing problems successfully with my program.

Input to the program:

Two lists top[] and bottom[] containing pin names. Pin names should be integers.

File named Route_Figure11.py :

The top and bottom pins of the file named Figure11.py are taken from Figure 11 of Dr.Kalla's publication:
http://www.ece.utah.edu/~kalla/papers/TCAD2014-optical-interconnects-kalla.pdf 

File named Route_Figure11b.py :

This file runs the same problem by selecting one pin from the left top and other pin from right bottom
(this cell selection is hard coded) and so on.

File named Route.py :

This file runs another channel routing problem example from the link below:

All programs are written to run on Python 2.7.

Programs contain top [] and bottom [] lists containing pins to be routed are inside Source code directory. This list is provided
by the user.
